Rodent Recognition Model – Simulation with Google Teachable Machine
Overview
This project aims to simulate and validate the proposed rodent recognition architecture using the Google Teachable Machine platform. The simulation focuses on building a basic image recognition model capable of identifying and classifying various types of rodents, providing a foundational step toward implementing an automated rodent detection system in agriculture.
Objective
To train and test a machine learning model that classifies rodent species into distinct categories using image-based data, as a proof of concept for automated rodent recognition.
Dataset
•	A total of 5 classes of rodents were used:
o	Rat
o	Mouse
o	Squirrel
o	Chipmunk
o	Mole
•	Images were downloaded from the internet and grouped based on the respective rodent category.
•	15 image samples per class were used for training the model.
Methodology
1.	The Google Teachable Machine was used for simulation due to its ease of use and fast prototyping capabilities.
2.	Images were uploaded and organized into five labeled categories.
3.	A training process was conducted using the sample images.
4.	After training, the model was tested to verify its ability to recognize and classify rodents into the defined categories.
